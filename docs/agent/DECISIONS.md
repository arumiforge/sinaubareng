### D-001 — No AI attribution
Accepted · 2026-10-30
No Claude/AI attribution in commits, PRs, GitHub comments, code, or docs. Enforced by `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.json`.
Reason: owner's requirement.

### D-002 — Language policy
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Repo markdown and code naming in English. UI text, app exports (Excel/CSV/Word/PDF), and generated PDFs in Indonesian.
Reason: owner's requirement; English keeps code/docs standard, Indonesian serves end users and readers.

### D-003 — Core stack
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Laravel, Nginx, PHP-FPM, Redis, multiple queue workers, Node.js (tooling), Python when needed, Cloudflare, Ubuntu Server 22.04 VPS, Tailwind + TailAdmin, Inertia.js, Filament, Telescope.
Reason: owner's requirement.

### D-004 — Database engine
Superseded by D-007 · 2026-10-30
MySQL vs MariaDB not chosen yet. Until decided, keep migrations and queries portable.

### D-005 — Svelte vs SvelteKit with Inertia
Superseded by D-008 · 2026-10-30
Owner mentioned "Inertia.js SvelteKit". Inertia works with plain **Svelte** (`@inertiajs/svelte`) — Laravel handles routing, so SvelteKit's router/server is not used. SvelteKit would only fit as a separate frontend talking to a Laravel API (no Inertia).
Recommendation: Inertia.js + Svelte. Awaiting owner confirmation.

### D-006 — Docs pipeline and parallel work
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Docs flow `docs/drafts/` → `docs/final/` → `docs/pdf/` (Indonesian). Work is phased; tasks run in parallel via sub-agents or sessions, coordinated through `PROGRESS.md` and `WORKFLOW.md`.
Reason: owner's requirement for staged, parallel, consistent, token-efficient work.

### D-007 — Database: MySQL 8
Accepted · 2026-10-30 · supersedes D-004
MySQL 8 (CHECK constraints from 8.0.16, mature JSON columns). Migrations may use MySQL 8 features.
Reason: owner's choice in the 2026-10-30 interview; matches the EDUNEXA developer notes.

### D-008 — Frontend: Inertia.js + plain Svelte
Accepted · 2026-10-30 · supersedes D-005
`@inertiajs/svelte` with Laravel routing. No SvelteKit.
Reason: owner confirmed the recommendation in D-005.

### D-009 — Product scope: content creation + administration from v1
Accepted · 2026-10-30
SIGRAK (working name) is an AI-assisted platform for making teaching content (Guided Generator, Template Engine, AI Provider Engine) and keeps EDUNEXA's school administration features. Both ship in v1. See `docs/drafts/product-concept.md`.
Reason: owner's concept message and interview.

### D-010 — Users and access
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Roles: teacher (class/subject), principal, school operator, supervisor (read-only over supervised schools), internal staff (separate Filament console and guard). Students are records, never users. Every page needs login; only login, invitation acceptance, and password reset are reachable without a session. No public pages or share links.
Reason: owner's concept message and interview.

### D-011 — How games reach students
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Present mode inside the teacher's session, plus a standalone offline HTML download (no login, no network calls, teaching content only).
Reason: students are not users and there are no public pages (D-010), but students still need to play.

### D-012 — AI keys are teacher-owned, several per teacher
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Each teacher adds one or more Gemini keys from Google projects they own. Round robin + failover run only within that teacher's keys. No school or platform key. Principals need no key. AI cost is never a SIGRAK cost. Supersedes the optional school fallback key in the EDUNEXA notes.
Reason: owner's concept message and interview. Gemini quota is per project.

### D-013 — Template storage: code + DB registry
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Template definitions, schemas, renderers, and game runtimes live in the repo. The DB holds the registry (active flag, versions) and optional prompt-instruction overrides edited in Filament, which create a new immutable version.
Reason: testable, versioned code with prompt tuning that needs no deploy.

### D-014 — v1 templates
Accepted · 2026-10-30
RPM (incl. kokurikuler variant), Bank Soal, LKPD, Quiz Battle, and Buat bebas (guided). Drag & Drop, Word Puzzle, Maze, and Flashcard come later.
Reason: owner's choice. Quiz Battle reuses Bank Soal, so the document-to-game path is proven early.

### D-015 — No AI-generated code in v1
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Games are built only from template runtimes. AI supplies content and allowed config values. Teachers' requests for missing features are logged for the team.
Reason: quality, consistency, and security.

### D-016 — Offline: Di Kelas only
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Attendance, journal, and student notes work offline and sync by `client_uuid`. Everything else needs a connection.
Reason: owner's choice. Keeps the PWA scope small.

### D-017 — Brand line
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Tagline "Kerja guru, lebih sigrak." Promise "Bahan ajar siap pakai dan administrasi beres, tanpa menulis prompt." The name SIGRAK stays a working name until checked in PDKI.
Reason: the old promise covered administration only.

### D-018 — Market: SD/MI, not limited to Kudus
Accepted · 2026-10-30
SD/MI grades 1–6 anywhere in Indonesia. Local content and the school calendar are configurable per region and per school. Kudus is the pilot and supplies the defaults. SMP/MTs come later, once curriculum data exists.
Reason: owner's choice. Supersedes "Kudus only" in the rebranding notes.

### D-019 — Validation flow
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Generated content is usable at once. Principal and supervisor can view and comment. Only school-changed or school-added curriculum goes through teacher → principal → supervisor.
Reason: owner kept the EDUNEXA rule.

### D-020 — Fresh build, curriculum-only import
Accepted · 2026-10-30
No Firebase migration of accounts, RPM, questions, or scores. Only curriculum JSON (KM-SD-2026-R2) is imported. Teachers are re-invited. Supersedes the staged migration plan in the EDUNEXA notes.
Reason: owner's choice. A new stack and a new data model.

### D-021 — Teacher navigation
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Hari Ini · Di Kelas · Buat · Asesmen · Kelas Saya. "Rencana" becomes "Buat" (template gallery, Buat bebas, Kurikulum, Kokurikuler). Dokumen Saya goes in the account menu.
Reason: owner's choice. Keeps a 5-item bottom nav.

### D-022 — AI engine technical choices
**Proposed** · 2026-10-30 · item 2 superseded by D-024
(1) Own `AIProvider` interface with a Gemini adapter on Laravel's HTTP client, not the Laravel AI SDK (per-call key choice and raw error classification are core; the SDK can become the transport later).
(2) ~~One generic `RunGeneration` job that runs the next step and re-dispatches itself.~~ Superseded by D-024.
(3) Progress by polling (Inertia partial reload), websockets later only if needed.
(4) Education logic lives in `app/Content/`, provider logic in `app/AI/`.
Reason: see `docs/drafts/ai-provider-engine.md`. Awaiting owner review.

### D-023 — AI keys: Gemini free tier only
Accepted · 2026-10-30 · refines D-012
Only Google Gemini keys are accepted, and the design targets the free tier: few calls per generation, stable models only, no background pings. Multi-key rotation stays, at the teacher's own risk. Google's API terms forbid circumventing limits, so the second and later keys need explicit consent. No student personal data goes into prompts, because free-tier prompts may be read by Google's reviewers. AI users are adults (teachers) only.
Reason: owner's decision; Gemini API Additional Terms and Google APIs Terms checked 2026-10-30.

### D-024 — No generic generator; one job per content type
Accepted · 2026-10-30 · supersedes D-022 item 2 and removes "Buat bebas" from D-014
Every content type has its own template, wizard, and queued job (`GenerateRpm`, `GenerateBankSoal`, `GenerateLkpd`, `GenerateQuizBattle`, `GenerateTkaPackage`, plus `ReviseSection`). They share only the runner, the AI gateway, the editor shell, and export. There is no "make anything" generator.
Reason: owner — a generic generator is something teachers can already do in Gemini directly.

### D-025 — Subscriptions are paid outside BOS
Accepted · 2026-10-30
Subscriptions are paid from funds other than BOS. Sales material never presents BOS as a payment source.
Reason: owner's decision.

### D-026 — Exams: Mode Ujian inactive, TKA practice CBT in v1
Accepted · 2026-10-30
The general Bank Soal "Mode Ujian" is switched off for now. v1 adds a TKA practice exam (CBT) for grade 6, modelled on the national TKA SD/MI (Bahasa Indonesia and Matematika, 75 minutes each, the forms PG / PGK MCMA / PGK Kategori, scores 0–100 with the TKA categories). Questions come from a dedicated "Paket Soal TKA" template that follows the Kerangka Asesmen TKA (Perka BSKAP 047/H/AN/2025).
Reason: owner's decision. Timed to be ready before TKA 2027 practice.

### D-027 — TKA exam access: exam cards + proctor token on a separate exam site
Accepted · 2026-10-30 · narrow exception to D-010
Students take the practice exam on a separate exam site (own subdomain and guard) with a per-session exam card (username + password) and a rotating proctor token (TOTP-style, 15 min). Credentials expire when the session closes. The exam site never calls the AI and links nowhere into the app. Students remain records, not users.
Reason: owner's choice. Also keeps Gemini's under-18 restriction away from the student-facing part.

### D-028 — Document engines: Gotenberg for PDF, Laravel Excel for spreadsheets
Accepted · 2026-10-30 · resolves the open PDF engine question
PDF: Gotenberg 8 (Chromium + LibreOffice, Docker, internal network only) through `spatie/laravel-pdf`'s Gotenberg driver. It gives HTML/CSS fidelity, Arabic shaping, headers and footers, DOCX→PDF, merge, watermark, and PDF/A. Excel: Laravel Excel (`maatwebsite/excel`, PhpSpreadsheet), with styled multi-sheet exports, queued exports, and validated imports. DOCX: PhpWord TemplateProcessor. This adds Docker to the server, for this one service.
Reason: owner asked for powerful engines. Dompdf/mPDF are too weak for the documents; Browsershot would need Node/Chromium on the host.

### D-029 — Attendance is daily
Accepted · 2026-10-30
One attendance record per student per day, taken by the homeroom teacher. Per-lesson attendance comes later.
Reason: owner's decision.
